- test using valgrind
- lib name should be group name + suffix/prefix ?!
  user should have complete control => no default suffix/perfix
  headers should be installed in pkgincludedir? maybe yes on the other hand
  the user can pass the directory to configure via --includedir
- missing nodist_ problem:
  we use an old automake version which doesn't support the nodist_ prefix
  => make clean and make dist depend on generated sources
  (i did not find a better solution)

  (make clean now works twice because the example is now in its own package
   and make clean is then able to create the files - just to remove them again ;-)

- make distcheck from clean source not working? now it works (really strange)
  it still sometimes does not work - after a make distclean? yes
  this does not work:
  dmake distclean && ./configure --prefix=/tmp/jens-delme/usr && dmake distcheck
  nor:
  dmake distclean && ./configure --prefix=/tmp/jens-delme/usr && dmake clean && dmake distcheck
  but this works:
  dmake distclean && ./configure --prefix=/tmp/jens-delme/usr && dmake && dmake clean && dmake distcheck

  the difference is in Makefile.in:
  the version that works has dependencies added the other version doesn't have
  (=> automake adds them?)
