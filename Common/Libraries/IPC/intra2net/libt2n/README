libt2n version 0.7
-------------------------------------------------------------------
libt2n (talk2neighbor) is a C++ IPC (inter process communication) library
with an additional code generator (libt2n-codegen).

Before inventing our own IPC library, we checked a lot of other IPC frameworks
like CORBA, D-BUS and ICE. But they weren't easy to use and did not allow
passing complex C++ objects like vectors, maps and your own classes.

Communication between client and server is currently done using
Unix domain sockets (named pipes) or TCP. But the library is designed
transport-independent, so it can be expanded to
shared memory or other mechanisms.

Serializing all the complex objects is done with Boost serialization. 
The complete manual is generated by doxygen in the doc directory.

Changes from 0.6
----------------
* add support for external select() calls
* reset timeout if connection is active
* cmake build system and general cmake support
* prevent buffer overflow with overlong socket paths
* fix compilation with newer gcc / glibc versions
