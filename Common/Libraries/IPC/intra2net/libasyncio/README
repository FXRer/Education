libasyncio
===========

A library providing for dealing with asynchronous IO.

The basic idea for this lib is to provide classes which hide the details
of polling/selecting for events on file descriptors and provide a more
convenient interface which supports the idea of event driven programming.


The library was originally developed by Intra2net AG as part of the
Intranator connection daemon which is part of the Intranator (see http://www.intra2net.com/).
During development it was extracted as a separate module.
We then decided to publish it under The GNU Public License (GPL) + linking exception.
See the "LICENSE" file for more details.



libasyncio provides:

- basic class for handling reading from and writing to fd's
- filter plugin support for incoming/outgoing data.
- timer events
- deferred function calls; "frozen" function calls
- start and handle subprocesses (connecting to their stdin/stdout/stderr)
- unix domain socket handling
- event signals (using boost-signal lib)
- ... and some more stuff.


It depends on the boost library (see http://www.boost.org/).
