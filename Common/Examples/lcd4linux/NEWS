lcd4linux-0.98

- improved signal-handling: lcd4linux can be restarted by sending a SIGHUP

- lcd4linux uses syslog for messages/warnings etc.

- support for GPO's (general purpose outputs, e.g. to connect a LED)
  The MatroxOrbital Displays have one GPO, and you can connect up to eight
  LED's to the parallel port using two IC's (see README.HD44780.GPO)

- new delay loop for parallel port displays: uses either gettimeofday() or
  rdtsc (time stamp counter on newer processors). This delay needs no longer
  a calibration! The 'Delay'-entry in lcd4linux.conf has gone.

- new raster driver for PNG creation

- new curses-based text driver

- security: lcd4linux.conf must have the same user/group than the executable, 
  and must not me accesible by group and other (i.e. mode 0600). This is 
  necessary because lcd4linux.conf can contain usernames and passwords for 
  POP and IMAP queries.

- support for plugins: new token 'x1'..'x9' for externel programs

- new token 'ic' (ISDN connected/offline, mainly for a LED connected to a GPO)

- APM client: new tokens 'bp', 'bs', 'bd' (battery percentage, status and 
  duration)

- mail client: new tokens 'e1'..'e9' for counting emails in local mailboxes

- new configure-options '--with-drivers=<list>', so you can compile a minimal
  executable which contains only the drivers you need.

- seti@home client: new tokens 'hc' (% completed) and 'ht' (cpu time needed)

- simple web-server driver (see README.Webinterface)

- uses new (kernel 2.4) ppdev system to access parallel port via ioctl()

- mail suport for pop3 and imap4, token 'u1' ..'u9' show unseen mail
  (which is propably incorrect for normal mbox)

- added another verbose level (-vvv) for debugging socket traffic

- added nntp support for count of news/unread messages in subscribed NGs

- implemented time series bar '$t'
